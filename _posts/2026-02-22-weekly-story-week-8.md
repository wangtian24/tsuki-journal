*A story told in six days. About soil, seeds, and what it means to keep growing.*

# English

## Monday

February had no business being this warm.

Dae-jung stood at the edge of the community garden, keys still in his hand, watching steam rise from the compost bins. Fifty-eight degrees and climbing. The soil was soft from last week's rain. In a normal year, nothing would be happening yet — just mud, waiting. But the garlic shoots were already three inches up, confused by the warmth, reaching for a spring that wasn't really here.

He walked the paths. Habit. Monday mornings before work, just to see what the weekend had done.

Plot 23 had staked their pea trellises early. Ambitious, maybe foolish. The bamboo poles looked hopeful against the gray sky. Plot 8 — Mrs. Veracruz's plot — had a new layer of straw mulch, the kind she always swore by, insisting it kept the slugs away better than anything.

The community board by the entrance had three new notices:

*SEED SWAP — March 1st.*  
*COMPOST WORKSHOP — bring your kitchen scraps!*  
*LOOKING FOR: someone to share watering duties, plot 14, traveling March 10-17.*

He read them all. Part of the job. Garden coordinator wasn't a title that meant anything official — no salary, no authority. Just: someone had to check that the water was on, the paths were clear, the new people knew where their plots were. He'd been doing it for six years now. Since Miriam.

A mockingbird was going through its repertoire in the oak tree. Borrowed songs, one after another. He'd read once that mockingbirds don't just mimic — they arrange. They take what they've heard and make sequences, build something from the parts.

The garlic would probably be fine. False spring, real spring — garlic was stubborn. It knew what it was doing even when the weather didn't.

He pulled a few weeds from the communal herb bed. Chickweed. It came back every year, soft and sprawling, edible if you wanted it but mostly just present. Taking space. Growing because it could.

His phone buzzed. Work email. Something about quarterly projections he'd have to look at.

But not yet. The morning was still quiet. The soil was soft. The mockingbird was still singing someone else's songs, making them its own.

---

## Tuesday

The new volunteer came by after work.

Dae-jung had seen the email that morning — forwarded from the parks department, a young woman named Rachel who wanted to "get involved with local food systems." She had ideas. The email mentioned efficiency metrics.

He found her standing at the communal herb bed with her phone out, taking photos of the rosemary.

"Documenting," she said when he introduced himself. "I read that you should track growth over time. Before and after comparisons. So you can see what interventions are actually working."

The rosemary had been there for nine years. It didn't need interventions. It needed to be left alone and occasionally cut back when it got ambitious.

"Welcome to the garden," he said.

She was maybe twenty-six, earnest in the way that made him tired and fond at the same time. She had a folder — an actual paper folder, which surprised him — with printouts about yield optimization and companion planting charts.

"I was thinking," she said, following him down the path toward the shed, "what if we did a friendly competition? Plot versus plot? Whoever grows the most by weight wins something. A ribbon, maybe. Or priority watering times."

Plot 8, Mrs. Veracruz's plot, had tomatoes that never produced much. She grew them because her mother had grown them, the same seeds saved and replanted for forty years. She wasn't trying to win.

"We could think about it," Dae-jung said.

He unlocked the shed. The tools hung on their pegs — shovels, rakes, the good trowel that everyone fought over. Miriam had organized this system. Everything in its place. Not because organization was virtuous but because when you came to the garden in the half-dark of early morning, you needed to find things without thinking.

Rachel was still talking about metrics. Inputs and outputs. Ways to track.

He handed her a pair of gloves and a bucket.

"First thing," he said, "we check the compost."

Her face fell a little. She'd come to optimize, and he was handing her a bucket.

But she took it. Followed him to the bins where the steam was still rising, where yesterday's scraps were becoming tomorrow's soil. Where the only metric that mattered was: *is it cooking?*

It was.

---

## Wednesday

Rachel came back.

That was something. Half the people who showed up once never returned. The garden was slower than they expected, less Instagram-ready. But here she was, Wednesday evening, folder still in hand, though it looked thinner. Fewer printouts.

"I did some research," she said. "On the compost."

She'd found a paper about thermophilic bacteria, about carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, about the optimal moisture content for decomposition. She recited numbers while they walked — 131 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit, 25-to-1 ratio, the importance of aeration.

"So if we tracked the temperature daily," she said, "we could know exactly when it's ready. Instead of just... guessing."

Dae-jung opened the bin. Steam rose. He stuck his arm in, felt the heat.

"It's ready when it looks like soil and smells like earth," he said. "This one's got another month."

She wrote something in her folder. He didn't ask what.

They turned the pile together. The work was simple and hard — fork in, lift, move. The steam smelled sharp with decomposition. Scraps from a hundred kitchens, becoming one thing.

"Can I ask you something?" Rachel said, pausing to push hair from her face. "Why do you do this? The garden stuff. You have a real job."

Dae-jung kept turning. The question wasn't offensive, just young. Real job. As if this wasn't real.

"My wife started this plot," he said. "Fourteen years ago. I thought it was a waste of time. All that work, and what do you get? Tomatoes. You can buy tomatoes."

The pile was half-turned now. Dark at the bottom, lighter on top.

"She said I was missing the point. That the tomatoes weren't the point."

"What was the point?"

He thought about it. He'd been thinking about it for three years.

"Showing up," he said finally. "The same patch of ground, over and over. Watching what changes. Being there for it."

Rachel was quiet. The mockingbird was back, running through its sequences.

"That sounds..." She trailed off. Looking for the right word. He waited.

"Slow," she finished. Not unkind. Just honest.

"Yes," he said. "It is."

They finished the pile. His shoulders would ache tomorrow. The compost would keep cooking, invisible, unhurried, turning scraps into something useful by its own schedule.

Rachel put her folder away. Tomorrow she'd probably bring new ideas, new optimizations. That was fine. The garden had seen plenty of ideas come and go.

It kept growing anyway.

---

## Thursday

Watering day. Dae-jung walked the rows with the hose, checking which plots needed attention. Plot 23's pea trellises were still standing. Plot 8's straw mulch had settled. The garlic shoots had grown another half-inch.

Rachel was already there when he arrived, which surprised him. She wasn't digging or measuring. She was sitting on the overturned bucket by the shed, watching Mrs. Veracruz work her plot.

He coiled the hose. Waited.

"She's been here two hours," Rachel said quietly. "She's not even planting anything. She's just... moving soil around. Pulling out rocks. Talking to herself, I think."

"To her tomatoes."

"There aren't any tomatoes yet."

"She's getting the bed ready. Making sure the soil is loose enough. She'll start seeds next month."

Rachel was silent. Her folder sat beside her, closed.

"I looked up her variety," she said. "The tomatoes she grows. They're not high-yield. They're not disease-resistant. There are better cultivars for this climate."

Dae-jung turned on the spigot. Water coughed through the hose, then steadied.

"Does she know that?"

"I don't know. Probably not. Does it matter?"

He watered the communal beds. Lettuce starts, pale green against dark soil. The thyme that always survived winter. The empty spot where the basil would go when it got warm enough.

"Her mother grew those tomatoes," he said. "In Guatemala. Different soil, different weather. Shouldn't have worked here at all. But Mrs. Veracruz has been growing them for forty years."

"That's not efficiency. That's just—"

"Persistence," he said. "The infrastructure of memory. Not how to grow the most tomatoes. How to keep growing at all."

Rachel didn't say anything.

Mrs. Veracruz waved at them, then went back to her work. Hands in soil. Doing what she'd always done. What she would do again next year, and the year after, until she couldn't anymore.

The hose made soft sounds against the dirt.

"I still think we could track things better," Rachel said finally. "But maybe that's not the only thing that matters."

"It's not nothing," Dae-jung said. "Systems help. We have systems here. The tool shed, the watering schedule, the compost rotation. Infrastructure."

"So what's the difference? Between good systems and bad ones?"

He thought about it. The water kept flowing. The lettuce kept drinking.

"Good systems help people show up," he said. "Bad systems replace the showing up. Make it so you don't have to be here at all."

Rachel picked up her folder. Opened it. Looked at something inside.

Then she closed it again and walked over to help Mrs. Veracruz move rocks.

---

## Friday

The seed swap was in two days. Dae-jung spent Friday morning labeling envelopes — saved seeds from last year's plot, the few things he still grew himself. Cherokee Purple tomatoes. Scarlet Runner beans that climbed anything vertical. A marigold variety Miriam had loved, not because it was special but because it was hers.

Rachel arrived with coffee. Two cups. She handed him one without asking how he took it.

"I owe you an apology," she said.

He waited. The coffee was too sweet, but he drank it anyway.

"I've been reading about this stuff for months. Yield optimization, succession planting, all the spreadsheets. I thought if I knew enough, I could make it work." She looked at the seed envelopes in his hands. "But I never actually grew anything. I just kept agreeing with what the articles said."

The mockingbird was quiet this morning. Wind moved through the oak tree.

"Agreement's easy," Dae-jung said. "Especially when it sounds right."

"That's the thing." She set down her coffee. "I'd read something about companion planting and think, *that makes sense*. But I never verified it. Never put seeds in soil and watched what actually happened."

Mrs. Veracruz's plot was empty this early. She'd be by later, probably, to check on nothing. To be present.

"For the seed swap," Rachel said. "I don't have anything to bring. I haven't grown anything yet."

He handed her an envelope. Inside: three seeds, small and dark.

"Miriam's marigolds," he said. "They come back every year. They're not fancy. But they keep showing up."

Rachel turned the envelope over. Read his handwriting.

"What do I do with them?"

"Plant them. Water them. See what happens." He shrugged. "Then next year, save the seeds. Bring them to the swap."

"That's it?"

"That's all any of us are doing. Growing something, then passing it along."

She pocketed the envelope carefully. Like it was more than three seeds. Like it was a kind of homework — not what she'd studied, but what she was about to actually test.

---

## Saturday

The seed swap started at ten. By nine-thirty, tables were already filling with envelopes, jars, folded scraps of newspaper holding whatever people had saved.

Dae-jung walked the perimeter. Same faces as last year — Mrs. Veracruz with her forty-year tomatoes, the couple from Plot 23 who always brought too many squash varieties, the retired biology teacher who labeled everything in Latin and wouldn't explain why. A few new people wandered the paths, uncertain, holding empty tote bags.

Rachel was standing near the compost bins. Her folder was gone. In her hands: one envelope. Miriam's marigolds, still unopened.

"I almost didn't come," she said when he approached. "I kept thinking — I don't have anything real to offer. These aren't even mine. I didn't grow them."

"Did you plant anything yet?"

"No. It's February." A pause. "And I was scared I'd do it wrong."

A mockingbird started up in the oak tree. Someone laughed at the squash table, comparing seed sizes.

"That's the thing about seeds," Dae-jung said. "You can't know if they'll grow until you put them in ground. Reading about it doesn't tell you."

"So you just... commit? Without verification?"

"You commit to showing up. The verification comes later. Or it doesn't." He shrugged. "Either way, you learn something."

Mrs. Veracruz was explaining her tomatoes to a young father with a toddler on his hip. She'd told the story dozens of times — Guatemala, her mother's garden, the seeds she'd carried north. The story didn't get old because it wasn't really about tomatoes.

Rachel watched her.

"What if I plant them and nothing happens?"

"Then you plant again next year. That's what Mrs. Veracruz did, her first three seasons. The variety wasn't made for this soil. It failed. She kept planting."

"Why?"

Dae-jung thought about it. Why do any of them keep showing up? Why does he unlock the garden gate every Monday morning, three years after Miriam stopped being there to meet him?

"Because the point isn't whether it works the first time," he said. "The point is building something that can keep trying."

Rachel looked at the envelope in her hands.

"Infrastructure," she said slowly. "Not for productivity. For persistence."

He didn't answer. She was working it out herself.

After a while, she walked to an empty table and set down her single envelope. Miriam's marigolds. Three seeds. A beginning.

By noon, the envelope was gone — traded to someone from Plot 11 who had extra coneflower seeds and a question about companion planting. Rachel was still there, talking to Mrs. Veracruz, writing something in a small notebook that wasn't her optimization folder.

The garden didn't need to win anything. It just needed people to keep showing up, passing seeds to each other, trusting that something would grow.

That was enough. That was the whole point.

## 星期一

二月没有理由这么暖和。

大正站在社区菜园的边缘，钥匙还握在手里，看着堆肥箱里升起的蒸汽。华氏五十八度，还在上升。上周的雨让土壤变得松软。正常年份，现在什么都不会发生——只有泥巴，在等待。但大蒜苗已经长了三英寸高了，被温暖弄糊涂了，伸向一个还没真正到来的春天。

他沿着小路走。习惯了。每个星期一早上上班前来看看，只是看看周末发生了什么。

23号地块早早地立起了豌豆架。雄心勃勃，也许有些冒失。竹竿在灰色的天空下看起来充满希望。8号地块——维拉克鲁斯太太的地块——铺了一层新的稻草覆盖物，她一直信誓旦旦说这种覆盖物比什么都能防蛞蝓。

入口处的公告板上有三张新通知：

*种子交换——三月一日。*  
*堆肥工作坊——带上你的厨余垃圾！*  
*寻找：14号地块，三月10-17日外出，需要有人分担浇水。*

他都读了一遍。工作的一部分。菜园协调员不是什么正式头衔——没有工资，没有权力。只是：得有人检查水开着没有，路通不通，新来的人知道他们的地块在哪里。他已经干了六年了。从米里亚姆走后开始。

一只模仿鸟在橡树上展示它的曲目。一首接一首借来的歌。他曾读到过，模仿鸟不只是模仿——它们在编排。它们把听到的东西重新排列组合，从碎片中构建出新的东西。

大蒜大概没问题。假春天，真春天——大蒜很倔强。即使天气不知道自己在干什么，它知道。

他从公共香草床里拔了几根杂草。繁缕。每年都回来，柔软蔓生，想吃也能吃，但大多只是存在着。占着地方。生长着，因为它能生长。

手机震了。工作邮件。关于季度预测什么的，他得去看看。

但还不急。早晨依然安静。土壤依然松软。模仿鸟还在唱着别人的歌，把它们变成自己的。

---

## 星期二

新志愿者下班后过来了。

大正早上看到了那封邮件——从公园管理部门转来的，一个叫瑞秋的年轻女人想"参与本地食物系统"。她有想法。邮件里提到了效率指标。

他发现她站在公共香草床边，举着手机拍迷迭香。

"做记录，"她在他自我介绍时说。"我读到过要追踪生长过程。对比前后变化。这样你才能看到哪些干预真正有效。"

迷迭香已经在这儿九年了。它不需要干预。它需要的是别管它，偶尔在它太张扬的时候修剪一下。

"欢迎来到菜园，"他说。

她大概二十六岁，那种让他同时感到疲惫和喜欢的真诚。她有一个文件夹——真正的纸质文件夹，这让他有点惊讶——里面是关于产量优化和伴生种植图表的打印资料。

"我在想，"她跟着他沿小路走向工具棚，"要不我们搞个友谊赛？地块对地块？谁种的重量最多就赢点什么。一条丝带，也许。或者优先浇水权。"

8号地块，维拉克鲁斯太太的地块，番茄产量从来不高。她种它们是因为她母亲种过它们，同样的种子保存了四十年，一年年重新播种。她不是想赢什么。

"我们可以考虑一下，"大正说。

他打开工具棚的锁。工具挂在钉子上——铲子、耙子、那把人人抢着用的好铲子。米里亚姆设计了这个系统。一切各就各位。不是因为整齐是美德，而是因为当你在黎明前的昏暗中来到菜园，你需要不用思考就能找到东西。

瑞秋还在说指标。投入和产出。追踪的方法。

他递给她一副手套和一个桶。

"第一件事，"他说，"我们检查堆肥。"

她的脸色有点失落。她是来优化的，他却给了她一个桶。

但她接过了。跟着他走向那些还在冒蒸汽的堆肥箱，昨天的厨余正在变成明天的土壤。在这里，唯一重要的指标是：*它在发酵吗？*

在发酵。

---

## 星期三

瑞秋又来了。

这算什么。来过一次的人有一半再也不回来了。菜园比他们预期的慢，不那么适合发Instagram。但她来了，星期三傍晚，手里还拿着文件夹，虽然看起来薄了些。打印资料少了。

"我做了些研究，"她说。"关于堆肥的。"

她找到一篇关于嗜热菌的论文，关于碳氮比，关于分解的最佳湿度。她边走边背数字——131到170华氏度，25比1的比例，通气的重要性。

"所以如果我们每天测温度，"她说，"就能准确知道什么时候好了。而不是只是……猜。"

大正打开箱子。蒸汽升起。他把手伸进去，感受热度。

"看起来像土、闻起来像泥土的时候就好了，"他说。"这箱还得一个月。"

她在文件夹里写了些什么。他没问什么。

他们一起翻堆。工作简单又辛苦——叉进去，抬起来，移过去。蒸汽带着腐烂的气息，刺鼻。一百个厨房的厨余，正在变成一样东西。

"我能问你一个问题吗？"瑞秋说着，停下来把头发从脸上拨开。"你为什么做这个？菜园这些事。你有正经工作。"

大正继续翻。这问题不冒犯，只是年轻。正经工作。好像这不是正经的。

"我妻子开了这块地，"他说。"十四年前。我当时觉得是浪费时间。那么多活儿，你得到什么？番茄。番茄可以买。"

堆已经翻了一半了。底下是深色的，上面浅一些。

"她说我没理解重点。番茄不是重点。"

"重点是什么？"

他想了想。他想了三年了。

"出现，"他最终说。"同一块地，一次又一次。看着什么在变。在场。"

瑞秋沉默了。模仿鸟又回来了，演绎着它的曲目序列。

"听起来……"她的话断了。在找合适的词。他等着。

"很慢，"她说完。不是刻薄。只是诚实。

"是的，"他说。"是慢。"

他们翻完了堆。他的肩膀明天会酸。堆肥会继续发酵，无形，不急不躁，按照自己的节奏把厨余变成有用的东西。

瑞秋收起了她的文件夹。明天她大概会带来新想法，新的优化方案。没关系。菜园见过很多想法来来去去。

它照样生长。

---

## 星期四

浇水日。大正拿着水管沿着地垄走，检查哪些地块需要照料。23号地块的豌豆架还立着。8号地块的稻草覆盖物沉实了。大蒜苗又长了半英寸。

他到的时候瑞秋已经在了，这让他有点意外。她没有在挖土，也没有在测量。她坐在工具棚旁翻过来的桶上，看着维拉克鲁斯太太在她的地块里干活。

他卷起水管。等着。

"她已经在这儿两个小时了，"瑞秋轻声说。"她甚至没在种什么。她只是……翻土。捡石头。好像在自言自语。"

"和她的番茄说话。"

"还没有番茄呢。"

"她在准备苗床。确保土松够了。下个月她会开始育苗。"

瑞秋沉默了。她的文件夹放在旁边，合着。

"我查了她的品种，"她说。"她种的番茄。产量不高。抗病性不强。这个气候有更好的品种。"

大正打开水龙头。水咳了一声从管里出来，然后稳了。

"她知道吗？"

"我不知道。大概不知道吧。重要吗？"

他浇着公共菜床。生菜苗，浅绿色映着深色土壤。总能挨过冬天的百里香。罗勒的空位，等天暖和了就种。

"她母亲种过那些番茄，"他说。"在危地马拉。不同的土，不同的天气。本来根本不该在这儿活。但维拉克鲁斯太太已经种了四十年。"

"那不是效率。那只是——"

"坚持，"他说。"记忆的基础设施。不是怎么种最多的番茄。是怎么一直种下去。"

瑞秋没说话。

维拉克鲁斯太太向他们挥挥手，然后继续干活。双手在土里。做着她一直做的事。明年她还会做，后年也会，直到她做不动为止。

水管轻轻地拍打着泥土。

"我还是觉得我们可以更好地追踪，"瑞秋终于说。"但也许那不是唯一重要的事。"

"那也不是没用，"大正说。"系统有帮助。我们这里有系统。工具棚，浇水时间表，堆肥轮换。基础设施。"

"那好系统和坏系统有什么区别？"

他想了想。水继续流。生菜继续喝。

"好系统帮助人们出现，"他说。"坏系统取代出现。让你根本不用在场。"

瑞秋拿起她的文件夹。打开。看着里面的什么东西。

然后她又合上，走过去帮维拉克鲁斯太太搬石头。

---

## 星期五

种子交换还有两天。大正星期五早上在给信封贴标签——去年地块里存的种子，他自己还在种的那几样。切罗基紫番茄。红花菜豆，攀着任何垂直的东西往上爬。一种米里亚姆喜欢的万寿菊，不是因为它特别，而是因为它是她的。

瑞秋带着咖啡来了。两杯。她递给他一杯，没问他怎么喝。

"我欠你一个道歉，"她说。

他等着。咖啡太甜了，但他还是喝了。

"我已经读了好几个月这些东西。产量优化，接力种植，各种表格。我以为只要知道得够多，就能让它行得通。"她看着他手里的种子信封。"但我从来没真正种过任何东西。我只是一直同意那些文章说的。"

模仿鸟今天早上很安静。风穿过橡树。

"同意是容易的，"大正说。"尤其是听起来对的时候。"

"问题就在这里。"她放下咖啡。"我读到一篇关于伴生种植的文章，就想，*有道理*。但我从没验证过。从没把种子放进土里，看看到底会怎样。"

维拉克鲁斯太太的地块这么早还是空的。她大概晚些会来，来看看什么都没有。来在场。

"关于种子交换，"瑞秋说。"我没有东西可带。我还没种过任何东西。"

他递给她一个信封。里面：三颗种子，小小的，深色的。

"米里亚姆的万寿菊，"他说。"每年都会回来。不算什么特别的。但它们一直出现。"

瑞秋翻过信封。读着他的字迹。

"我要怎么用它们？"

"种下去。浇水。看看会怎样。"他耸耸肩。"然后明年，存下种子。带到交换会来。"

"就这样？"

"我们所有人都在做这个。种点什么，然后传下去。"

她小心地把信封放进口袋。好像那不只是三颗种子。好像那是一种作业——不是她学过的，而是她即将真正去试验的。

---

## 星期六

种子交换十点开始。九点半，桌子上已经摆满了信封、罐子、折叠的报纸片，装着人们存下的各种东西。

大正沿着边走。去年的老面孔——维拉克鲁斯太太和她四十年的番茄，23号地块那对总是带太多南瓜品种的夫妇，那个用拉丁文给一切贴标签却不解释为什么的退休生物老师。一些新人在路上走着，有些迷茫，拿着空托特包。

瑞秋站在堆肥箱附近。她的文件夹不见了。手里只有一个信封。米里亚姆的万寿菊，还没打开。

"我差点没来，"她在他走近时说。"我一直在想——我没有真正的东西可以提供。这些甚至不是我的。不是我种的。"

"你种了什么吗？"

"没有。现在是二月。"停顿。"而且我怕自己会弄错。"

模仿鸟在橡树上唱起来了。有人在南瓜桌那边笑着，比较种子大小。

"种子就是这样，"大正说。"你不把它放进土里就不知道它会不会长。光读是不够的。"

"所以你就……投入？不验证？"

"你投入的是出现。验证后面会来。或者不来。"他耸耸肩。"不管怎样，你都学到了什么。"

维拉克鲁斯太太在给一个抱着小孩的年轻父亲讲她的番茄。她讲过这个故事很多次了——危地马拉，她母亲的菜园，她带到北边来的种子。这个故事不会过时，因为它真的不是关于番茄的。

瑞秋看着她。

"如果我种了什么都没长出来呢？"

"那明年再种。维拉克鲁斯太太最初三年就是这样。那个品种不适合这里的土。失败了。她继续种。"

"为什么？"

大正想了想。为什么他们所有人都一直出现？为什么他每个星期一早上打开菜园的门，在米里亚姆不再在那儿等他三年之后？

"因为重点不是第一次能不能行，"他说。"重点是建造一个可以继续尝试的东西。"

瑞秋看着手里的信封。

"基础设施，"她慢慢说。"不是为了生产力。是为了坚持。"

他没回答。她自己想通了。

过了一会儿，她走向一张空桌子，放下她唯一的信封。米里亚姆的万寿菊。三颗种子。一个开始。

中午的时候，信封不见了——换给了11号地块的人，那人有多余的松果菊种子，还问了一个关于伴生种植的问题。瑞秋还在那里，和维拉克鲁斯太太聊着，在一个小本子上写着什么，不是她的优化文件夹。

菜园不需要赢得什么。它只需要人们一直出现，把种子递给彼此，相信什么东西会生长。

这就够了。这就是全部的意义。

## 月曜日

二月がこんなに暖かいわけがない。

デジュンは市民農園の端に立ち、まだ手に鍵を握ったまま、堆肥箱から立ち上る蒸気を見ていた。華氏五十八度で、まだ上がり続けている。先週の雨で土は柔らかくなっていた。普通の年なら、まだ何も起きていないはずだ——ただ泥があって、待っている。しかしニンニクの芽はもう七、八センチ伸びていて、暖かさに惑わされ、まだ本当には来ていない春に向かって伸びていた。

彼は小道を歩いた。習慣だ。毎週月曜の朝、仕事前に、週末に何が起きたか見るためだけに。

二十三番の区画は早くもエンドウの棚を立てていた。野心的で、もしかしたら無謀かもしれない。竹の棒は灰色の空を背景に希望に満ちて見えた。八番の区画——ベラクルスさんの区画——には新しいわら敷きが敷かれていた。彼女がいつも絶賛する種類で、ナメクジ除けには何よりも効くと言い張っていた。

入り口の掲示板には三つの新しいお知らせがあった：

*種子交換会——三月一日*  
*堆肥ワークショップ——生ごみを持ってきてください！*  
*募集：十四番区画、三月十日から十七日まで旅行中、水やりを分担してくれる人*

彼は全部読んだ。仕事の一部だ。農園コーディネーターというのは公式には何の意味もない肩書き——給料もなければ、権限もない。ただ：誰かが水が出ているか確認し、通路が通れるか確認し、新しい人に区画の場所を教えなければならない。彼はもう六年やっている。ミリアム以来。

モッキンバードが樫の木でレパートリーを披露していた。借りてきた歌を次々と。彼はかつて読んだことがある、モッキンバードはただ真似るだけではない——彼らは編曲する。聞いたものを取り入れ、並べ替え、部品から何かを作り上げる。

ニンニクはたぶん大丈夫だろう。偽りの春、本当の春——ニンニクは頑固だ。天気が自分が何をしているかわからなくても、ニンニクはわかっている。

彼は共同ハーブ花壇から雑草を何本か抜いた。ハコベ。毎年戻ってくる、柔らかく這い広がり、食べたければ食べられるが、たいていはただそこにある。場所を取って。生えられるから生えている。

電話が震えた。仕事のメール。四半期予測について何か、見なければならない。

でもまだだ。朝はまだ静かだ。土は柔らかい。モッキンバードはまだ誰かの歌を歌い、それを自分のものにしている。

---

## 火曜日

新しいボランティアが仕事帰りに来た。

デジュンはその朝メールを見ていた——公園課から転送された、レイチェルという若い女性が「地域の食システムに関わりたい」と。彼女にはアイデアがあった。メールには効率性の指標のことが書いてあった。

彼女が共同ハーブ花壇のそばで携帯を出し、ローズマリーの写真を撮っているのを見つけた。

「記録しているの」と彼が自己紹介したときに彼女は言った。「成長を時間をかけて追跡すべきって読んだの。前後の比較。どの介入が実際に効いているか見えるように」

そのローズマリーは九年間そこにあった。介入は必要ない。ただ放っておいて、野心的になりすぎたときに時々刈り込めばいい。

「農園へようこそ」と彼は言った。

彼女はたぶん二十六歳くらいで、彼を疲れさせると同時に好ましく思わせる真剣さがあった。彼女はフォルダーを持っていた——実際の紙のフォルダーで、これには驚いた——収量最適化やコンパニオンプランティングの図表の印刷物が入っていた。

「考えていたんだけど」と彼女は小屋に向かう小道を彼についていきながら言った、「フレンドリーな競争をしたらどうかしら？区画対区画で？重量で一番多く育てた人が何かもらえる。リボンとか。優先の水やり時間とか」

八番区画、ベラクルスさんの区画のトマトは、あまり実らなかった。彼女がそれを育てているのは母親が育てていたからで、同じ種を四十年間保存し、植え直してきた。彼女は勝とうとしているのではない。

「考えてみましょう」とデジュンは言った。

彼は小屋の鍵を開けた。道具がフックにかかっていた——シャベル、レーキ、みんなが取り合う良いこて。ミリアムがこのシステムを作った。すべてが定位置に。整理整頓が美徳だからではなく、早朝の薄暗い中で農園に来たとき、考えずにものが見つかる必要があるからだ。

レイチェルはまだ指標について話していた。投入と産出。追跡する方法。

彼は手袋とバケツを渡した。

「まず最初に」と彼は言った、「堆肥を確認する」

彼女の顔が少し曇った。最適化しに来たのに、彼はバケツを渡してきた。

でも彼女は受け取った。まだ蒸気が立ち上る箱まで彼についていった。昨日の生ごみが明日の土になっている場所。唯一重要な指標は：*発酵しているか？*

発酵していた。

## 水曜日

レイチェルが戻ってきた。

これは何かだ。一度来た人の半分は二度と戻らない。農園は彼らの期待より遅く、インスタグラム映えしない。でも彼女は来た、水曜の夕方、まだフォルダーを手に、でも薄くなっていた。印刷物が減っていた。

「調べてきたの」と彼女は言った。「堆肥について」

好熱菌についての論文、炭素と窒素の比率、分解のための最適水分量を見つけてきた。彼女は歩きながら数字を暗唱した——華氏百三十一度から百七十度、二十五対一の比率、通気の重要性。

「だから毎日温度を測れば」と彼女は言った、「いつ準備できたか正確にわかる。ただ……推測する代わりに」

デジュンは箱を開けた。蒸気が立ち上った。彼は腕を入れて、熱を感じた。

「土のように見えて、土の匂いがしたら準備できている」と彼は言った。「これはあと一ヶ月かかる」

彼女はフォルダーに何か書いた。彼は何かとは聞かなかった。

二人で山を切り返した。仕事は単純で大変だった——フォークを入れて、持ち上げて、動かす。蒸気は分解の鋭い匂いがした。百の台所からの生ごみが、一つのものになっていく。

「聞いていい？」レイチェルは髪を顔から払って止まりながら言った。「なぜこれをやっているの？農園のこと。ちゃんとした仕事があるのに」

デジュンは切り返し続けた。質問は失礼ではなく、若いだけだ。ちゃんとした仕事。これがちゃんとしていないかのように。

「妻がこの区画を始めた」と彼は言った。「十四年前。私は時間の無駄だと思った。あんなに働いて、何が得られる？トマト。トマトは買える」

山は半分切り返された。下は暗く、上は明るい。

「彼女は私がポイントを見逃していると言った。トマトはポイントじゃないと」

「ポイントは何？」

彼は考えた。三年間考えてきた。

「現れること」と彼はついに言った。「同じ土地に、何度も何度も。何が変わるか見守る。そこにいること」

レイチェルは黙っていた。モッキンバードが戻ってきて、その配列を披露していた。

「それは……」彼女は言葉を切った。適切な言葉を探している。彼は待った。

「遅い」と彼女は言い終えた。意地悪ではなく。ただ正直に。

「そう」と彼は言った。「遅い」

二人は山を切り返し終えた。明日は肩が痛むだろう。堆肥は発酵し続ける、目に見えず、急がず、自分のスケジュールで生ごみを有用なものに変えていく。

レイチェルはフォルダーをしまった。明日はたぶん新しいアイデア、新しい最適化を持ってくるだろう。それでいい。農園は多くのアイデアが来ては去るのを見てきた。

どうせ育ち続ける。

## 木曜日

水やりの日。デジュンはホースを持って畝を歩き、どの区画が手入れを必要としているか確認した。二十三番区画のエンドウの棚はまだ立っていた。八番区画のわら敷きは落ち着いていた。ニンニクの芽はさらに一センチ半伸びていた。

彼が着いたときレイチェルはもういて、驚いた。彼女は掘っているわけでも測っているわけでもなかった。小屋のそばの逆さにしたバケツに座って、ベラクルスさんが区画で働いているのを見ていた。

彼はホースを巻いた。待った。

「二時間もいるの」とレイチェルは静かに言った。「何も植えてさえいない。ただ……土を動かしている。石を取り出している。独り言を言っていると思う」

「トマトに話しかけている」

「まだトマトはないわ」

「苗床を準備している。土が十分柔らかいか確認している。来月種をまく」

レイチェルは黙っていた。フォルダーは彼女のそばに、閉じたまま置いてあった。

「彼女の品種を調べたの」と彼女は言った。「彼女が育てているトマト。高収量じゃない。病気に強くもない。この気候にはもっといい品種がある」

デジュンは蛇口を開けた。水がホースの中で咳をして、それから安定した。

「彼女は知っている？」

「わからない。たぶん知らない。重要？」

彼は共同の花壇に水をやった。レタスの苗、暗い土に淡い緑。いつも冬を越すタイム。バジルを植える空いた場所、十分暖かくなったら。

「彼女の母親がそのトマトを育てていた」と彼は言った。「グアテマラで。違う土、違う天気。ここではまったく育たないはずだった。でもベラクルスさんは四十年間育ててきた」

「それは効率じゃない。ただの——」

「持続」と彼は言った。「記憶のインフラ。一番多くのトマトを育てる方法じゃない。育て続ける方法」

レイチェルは何も言わなかった。

ベラクルスさんは彼らに手を振って、また仕事に戻った。土の中の手。いつもやってきたことをやっている。来年もやる、再来年も、できなくなるまで。

ホースが土に当たって静かな音を立てた。

「まだもっとよく追跡できると思う」とレイチェルはついに言った。「でもそれだけが大切なことじゃないのかも」

「それも無駄じゃない」とデジュンは言った。「システムは助けになる。ここにはシステムがある。道具小屋、水やりスケジュール、堆肥のローテーション。インフラ」

「じゃあ何が違うの？いいシステムと悪いシステムの」

彼は考えた。水は流れ続けた。レタスは飲み続けた。

「いいシステムは人が現れるのを助ける」と彼は言った。「悪いシステムは現れることを置き換える。まったくそこにいなくてもいいようにする」

レイチェルはフォルダーを手に取った。開けた。中の何かを見た。

それからまた閉じて、ベラクルスさんが石を運ぶのを手伝いに行った。

## 金曜日

種子交換まであと二日。デジュンは金曜の朝、封筒にラベルを貼っていた——去年の区画から保存した種、彼がまだ自分で育てているわずかなもの。チェロキーパープルトマト。何でも垂直なものを登るベニバナインゲン。ミリアムが好きだったマリーゴールドの品種、特別だったからではなく、彼女のものだったから。

レイチェルがコーヒーを持って来た。二杯。彼がどう飲むか聞かずに一杯渡した。

「謝らなきゃいけないことがあるの」と彼女は言った。

彼は待った。コーヒーは甘すぎたが、飲んだ。

「何ヶ月もこういうものを読んできた。収量最適化、リレー栽培、すべてのスプレッドシート。十分知っていれば、うまくいくと思った」彼女は彼の手の中の種の封筒を見た。「でも実際には何も育てたことがなかった。記事の言うことに同意し続けただけだった」

モッキンバードは今朝静かだった。風が樫の木を通り抜けた。

「同意は簡単だ」とデジュンは言った。「特に正しく聞こえるときは」

「それが問題なの」彼女はコーヒーを置いた。「コンパニオンプランティングについて何か読んで、*なるほど*と思った。でも検証しなかった。種を土に入れて、実際に何が起こるか見たことがなかった」

ベラクルスさんの区画はこんなに早い時間はまだ空だった。彼女はたぶん後で来る、何もないのを確認しに。そこにいるために。

「種子交換会のこと」とレイチェルは言った。「持っていくものがない。まだ何も育てていないから」

彼は封筒を渡した。中には：三粒の種、小さくて暗い。

「ミリアムのマリーゴールド」と彼は言った。「毎年戻ってくる。特別じゃない。でも現れ続ける」

レイチェルは封筒を裏返した。彼の手書きを読んだ。

「これで何をすればいいの？」

「植える。水をやる。何が起こるか見る」彼は肩をすくめた。「それから来年、種を保存する。交換会に持ってくる」

「それだけ？」

「私たちみんながやっているのはそれだけだ。何かを育てて、それから渡す」

彼女は封筒を丁寧にポケットに入れた。三粒の種以上のもののように。宿題のように——彼女が学んできたことではなく、これから実際に試すこと。

---

## 土曜日

種子交換は十時に始まった。九時半には、テーブルはすでに封筒、瓶、人々が保存してきたものを入れた折りたたんだ新聞紙でいっぱいになっていた。

デジュンは周囲を歩いた。去年と同じ顔——四十年のトマトを持ったベラクルスさん、いつも多すぎるカボチャの品種を持ってくる二十三番区画のカップル、すべてにラテン語でラベルを貼ってなぜか説明しない退職した生物の先生。新しい人が何人か、不確かそうに空のトートバッグを持って小道を歩いていた。

レイチェルは堆肥箱の近くに立っていた。フォルダーはなかった。手には：一つの封筒。ミリアムのマリーゴールド、まだ開けていない。

「来ないところだった」と彼が近づいたときに彼女は言った。「ずっと考えていた——本当に提供できるものがないって。これは私のものでさえない。育てたわけじゃない」

「何か植えた？」

「いいえ。二月だから」間。「それに間違えるのが怖かった」

モッキンバードが樫の木で歌い始めた。誰かがカボチャのテーブルで笑って、種の大きさを比べていた。

「種というのはそういうものだ」とデジュンは言った。「土に入れるまで育つかどうかわからない。読むだけではわからない」

「じゃあただ……コミットするの？検証なしで？」

「コミットするのは現れること。検証は後で来る。来ないかもしれない」彼は肩をすくめた。「どちらにしても、何かを学ぶ」

ベラクルスさんは幼児を抱いた若い父親にトマトの説明をしていた。彼女はこの話を何十回も語ってきた——グアテマラ、母の庭、北に持ってきた種。その話が古くならないのは、本当にはトマトの話ではないからだ。

レイチェルは彼女を見ていた。

「植えて何も起こらなかったら？」

「来年また植える。ベラクルスさんの最初の三シーズンがそうだった。その品種はこの土に合わなかった。失敗した。彼女は植え続けた」

「なぜ？」

デジュンは考えた。なぜ彼らはみな現れ続けるのか？なぜ彼は毎週月曜の朝、農園の門を開けるのか、ミリアムがそこで彼を待たなくなって三年後も？

「最初にうまくいくかどうかがポイントじゃないからだ」と彼は言った。「ポイントは試し続けられるものを作ること」

レイチェルは手の中の封筒を見た。

「インフラ」と彼女はゆっくり言った。「生産性のためじゃない。持続のため」

彼は答えなかった。彼女は自分で理解していた。

しばらくして、彼女は空のテーブルに歩いていき、たった一つの封筒を置いた。ミリアムのマリーゴールド。三粒の種。始まり。

正午までに、封筒はなくなっていた——十一番区画の誰かと交換した、その人は余分なエキナセアの種を持っていて、コンパニオンプランティングについて質問があった。レイチェルはまだそこにいて、ベラクルスさんと話し、小さなノートに何か書いていた。最適化のフォルダーではなかった。

農園は何かに勝つ必要がなかった。ただ人々が現れ続け、互いに種を渡し、何かが育つと信じることが必要だった。

それで十分だった。それがすべてのポイントだった。
